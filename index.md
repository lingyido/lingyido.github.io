# Blockchain Security Overview on NEO N3 Platform

Welcome to our blog on Blockchain Security, focusing on the NEO (N3 & X) platform. As blockchain technology becomes increasingly integral to decentralized applications, ensuring the security of smart contracts is more critical than ever. In this blog series, we aim to provide insights and best practices to help developers build robust and secure smart contracts on the NEO N3 platform.

## Why Blockchain Security Matters

Blockchain technology promises a decentralized and tamper-proof digital infrastructure. However, with the power of decentralization comes the responsibility of ensuring that the code governing smart contracts is secure. Vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to significant financial losses and damage the credibility of the entire ecosystem. As developers, it is essential to understand the potential security threats and how to mitigate them effectively.

## Key Security Topics on NEO N3

Here are some key security topics that will be covered in our N3 blog series. Even if you are familiar with all EVM-chain securities, these are very important topics for you.

### [Reentrancy Attacks](./reentrancy-attack.md)

Reentrancy attacks are a common vulnerability in smart contracts, where an attacker can repeatedly enter the same contract execution process, potentially leading to severe financial losses. Learn how to detect and prevent reentrancy attacks on the NEO N3 platform.

### [Access Control and Permissions](./access-control.md)

Properly managing access control and permissions is crucial for ensuring that only authorized entities can interact with sensitive parts of your smart contract. This post will dive into best practices for implementing secure access controls on NEO N3.

### [Data Storage Security](./data-storage-security.md)

Storing data securely on the blockchain is essential to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information. We will explore techniques for protecting data stored within smart contracts on NEO N3.

### [Random Data Integration](./random-security.md)

### [Smart Contract Testing and Auditing](./testing-auditing.md)

Rigorous testing and auditing are fundamental to identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities before deploying smart contracts. We will cover best practices for testing and auditing smart contracts on the NEO N3 platform.
